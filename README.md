## What's Glue?
Glue is an adhesive substance used for sticking objects or materials together ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

**Glue** is also an helper package made to quickly bootstrap packages-based applications.
At its core it's just a container and a quick PSR7 setup, on top of which are glued together service providers and middlewares.

This is _not_ a microframework (in the sense that it doesn't frame your work). If this is what you're looking for I recommend instead using [Silex], [Slim] or whatever you want.
On the contrary, Glue is as its name indicates just a bit of glue to tie existing packages and middlewares together. It doesn't assume much, it won't get in your way, it's just a way to tie stuff together.

### What does it look like
To be concise, Glue turns a common setup such as the following (container + router + PSR7):

```php
<?php
// Create container
$container = new Container();
$container->addServiceProvider(SomeProvider::class);
$container->addServiceProvider(AnotherProvider::class);

// Create router and routes
$router = new RouteCollection($container);
$router->get('/', 'SomeController::index');

// Create PSR7 middleware handler
$relay = (new RelayBuilder())->newInstance([
    SomeMiddleware::class,
    function($request, $response, $next) use ($router) {
        $next($request, $router->dispatch($request, $response));
    },
]);

// Create PSR7 stack
$request = ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals();
$response = $relay(new Request, new Response());

(new SapiEmitter())->emit($response);
```

Into this:

```php
$app = (new Glue())
    ->setServiceProviders([
        new SomeServiceProvider(),
        new AnotherServiceProvider(),
        new LeagueRouteServiceProvider(),
    ])
    ->setMiddlewares([
        SomeMiddleware::class,
        LeagueRouteMiddleware::class,
    ]);

// Decorates a router of your choice
$app->get('/', 'SomeController::index');

$app->run();
```

In order to be truly flexible, Glue accepts any PSR11 compatible container, and register its services through the [service-provider] standard.

As you can see Glue serves two purposes: eliminating recurring boilerplate in binding packages together, and providing service providers for common packages such as `league/route`.
It is configurable and flexible, it won't get in your way, it's just here to help you not type the same things over and over again.

### What's in the box
Glue provides several service providers out of the box:
- **Routing**
    - Base routing system with `league/route`
    - PSR7 stack with `zendframework/zend-diactoros`
    - View engine with `twig/twig`
    - Facultative base controller

- **Business**
    - Database handling with `illuminate/database`
    - Migrations with `robmorgan/phinx`
    - Command bus with `league/tactician`

- **Development**
    - Dotenv files with `vlucas/phpdotenv`
    - Logs handling with `monolog/monolog`
    - Debugbar with `maximebf/debugbar`
    - Small CLI with `symfony/console`
    - Filesystem with `league/flysystem`
    - REPL with `psy/psysh`

Any of these can be overidden or removed; this package doesn't enforce any structure or the use of any dependency in particular.

Why? Because I do a lot of very small web applications, for myself or public ones, and I was tired of going through the same routine for the hundreth time.
Then I thought others might have the same use case and here we are.
